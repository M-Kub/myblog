	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p> 
		Hi there I'm Michael, a Self-taught programmer. I love to work with microcontrolllers like the "ESP32" or "Raspberry Pi Pico".
		Other areas I'm very interrested in is Webdevelopment, Databases(PostgreSQL especially) and Network communications.
		It's just fascinating for me how all of these different technologies are working and it is still blowing my mind how fast
		the technological progress was in the last twenty to thirty years. I'm very happy that this is such a broad field so I can
		always learn new things, having something your interested in which you can learn all of your life and never be done with
		is a really good thing I think. :)
