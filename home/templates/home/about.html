        About Me
    </h2>
    <div class="about">
	<p> 
        Hi there! I'm Michael. I'm a passionate, self-taught programmer.
        Since I was a little kid I always wanted to know how the world
        and the things in it are working. Sometimes my parents had to pay
        the price for that curiosity, because opening the family VCR and
        have a look at the components inside was easier then figuring out
        how to put the whole thing back together, so that left my family
        sometimes with devices that "mysteriously" stoped working.
        But most of the time it wasn't my fault, I promise. ðŸ˜‰
