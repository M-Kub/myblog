<h2 class="center">Overview</h2>
<p>
Hi I'm Michael, born in 1980 in a small town in germany. Today I'm a bit of an, what I like to call explorative hobby programmer. I only got into this profession 6 years ago
with the goal to understand how websites and all of this programming stuff works. So I decided to build a website from the ground up, not knowing what I was doing I choose
to learn django, python and all that's needed to run my own site. Well I accomplished at least the website building, the site you're reading this on, is the exact site, build
with django, python, nginx and postgresql. While doing all this, my focus shifted a little bit to the lower level architecture. Microcontrollers and how they interact with
different sensors and all those things really fascinates me.
